## üìê Clean Architecture

<img src="https://github.com/Danielvfrodrigues/TV-Dome/blob/main/new-clean-arch.png">

This project was developed base on the Clean Architecture.
Coding the app on Clean provides a plenty of benefits, such as: 

* Easier to maintain;
* Easier to spot bugs;
* Easier to understand;
* Easier for search engines to understand.
<br>


## üíª Design Pattern

<img src="https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/whatis-model_view_viewmodel.png" alt="MVVM Design Pattern">

For this application, the Design Pattern of choice was Model‚Äìview‚Äìviewmodel (MVVM).

The MVVM allows to easily organize the coding files by separating the Graphical User Interface files from the Business Logic files.

### Responsibilities and Characteristics

* ***Model:*** The Model encapsulates the business logic and the data structure of the app.

* ***View:*** The responsibility of the view is to define a appearence or structure presented on screen to the user.

* ***ViewModel:*** The ViewModel responsibility in MVVM's context is to provide a presentation logic to the View by implementing properties and commands so that the View may be able to fill it's controls and notify them.
<br>


## üß± SOLID Principles


SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles.

#### S - <ins>Single-responsibility Priciple</ins>
* A class should have one and only one job.
#### O - <ins>Open-closed Principle</ins>
* "Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."
#### L - <ins>Liskov Substitution Principle</ins>
* "Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class."
#### I - <ins>Interface Segregation Principle</ins>
* A class should not be forced to implement an interface that i doesn't need.
#### D - <ins>Dependency Inversion Principle</ins>
* "Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions."

## üìé Project Dependencies


#### <ins>RETROFIT:</ins>
* Https requests made easy;

#### <ins>GSON:</ins>
* Easy serialize and desserialize Json Objects;

#### <ins>KOIN:</ins>
* Implementing dependency injection provides access of anythin anywhere in the code at your desire;

#### <ins>NAVIGATION:</ins>
* Modern navigation ways for activities and fragments; ~~cuz' everyone is sick of Intents and Bundles!

#### <ins>PICASSO:</ins>
* Donwload apply images from the web in your app in just one code line;

#### <ins>COROUTINES:</ins>
* Asynchronous streams and Threadmanagement.<br>.

#### <ins>UI:</ins>
* Androidx Cardview,
* Androidx Splashscreen,
* Google Material
* and more...

## üöÄ How to use TV Dome?


TV Dome is a really intuitive app.

1. ***Home Screen***: In the Home Screen, you'll have a load of TV Shows disposed as cards. You just have to ***choose and tap*** over your favorite.
2. ***Show Details Screen***: After you choose and click, the app will show you, in a new screen, ***all the information*** about your TV Show of choice. Other than that, there is a floating button at the right-bottom side of the screen. By click, it will redirect you to the ***Season list screen***.
3. ***Season list screen***: Simply a scrollable list of all the seasons available to that show. On click, you'll be sent to the season's ***Episodes Grid Screen***.
4. ***Episodes Grid Screen***: In front of you will be all the episodes of the chosen season. ***Just click! :)***
5. ***Episode Details Screen***: Lastlly, a screen with all the information about the tapped episode.

P.S: In the Home, you'll be able to search for your favorite show.

#### ENJOY! :D
